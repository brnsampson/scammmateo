= Mr. PizzaMan in Downtown ScamMateo Announces New Products and Services to Rave Reviews =

Many residents of ScamMateo will already be familiar with Mr. PizzaMan. Located on 4th st. in downtown, it is known
for it's Pizza and Calzones, but not everyone knows that Mr. PizzaMan is so much more! While chicken wings and some
italian classics like Chicken Fettuccine or Baked Panne might not be surprising, the savory shop also sells sandwiches
under the monkier "Mr. SandwichMan"!

But this isn't even the last alias that the flexible Fettuccine vendor goes by! Those in the know also call the variable
vittle vendor "Mr. TacoMan", where they can get, you guessed it, tacos, burritos, and tortas! In addition, customers
have become accustomed to having other obvious options like acai bowls, fish and chips, burgers, and Brazillian BBQ.

What else could the discerning customer possibly want? Mr. PizzaMan, ever the innovator, is making a bold new bet and showing
that they know their clientele better than anyone.

"Over the years, we have done a lot of outreach and surveying of our customers to see what they really want. What they
are really hoping to see when they open that Mr. PizzaMan menu, you know," says Mr. PizzaMan owner Paulo Rossetto.

"That's why we are pleased to breaking new ground with a post-dessert menu which includes items our regulars have been
asking for for years. For $29.99 we will send a certified plumber to your home while you are having your Bife A Parmegiana
and Jalapenos Poppers to make sure everything is in order before you return home. For an extra $159.99 they will come back
four hours later for a follow up," boasts the enviable business owner.

He continued, "some longtime customers have also requested special
accomidations, and we finally have the requested private, sound-proofed bathroom for when you finish a calzone the size
of your head filled with a full pound of delicious ricotta, mozzarella, salami, and peperoni. Only $16.99 for a half hour
of privacy that you would swear isn't surrounded on all sides by sweaty men cooking slabs of meat for a Brazillian steak
only to immediately switch to slathering a meatball parmigiana sandwhich with a cup of hot tomato sauce and melted cheeze."

Customer reactions were also quite positive. One woman interviewed said, "I'm actually really happy that I can barricade
myself in a toilet prison of my own making after choosing to mix a philly cheesesteak with garlic bread. The only problem
is that after the first half hour is up they text me to make sure I'm still concious."

Another customer shared, "Yeah, I come here every tuesday after work so I just signed up to get the plumber out to my place
around 10pm afterwards for the next two months. This way I don't have to call my regular plumber all the time and have
them judging me. The Mr. PlumberMan service is discreet and doesn't ask questions because they already know why they are
there!"

There you have it folks, if you are looking for a restaurant that knows how to take care of their customers, come on
down to Mr. PizzaMan soon!
